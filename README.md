# Fidgetingbits' Standalone Neovim Config

This config is based on the idiomatic example from https://nixcats.org. I try
to mostly copy the lazyvim.nvim distro for most functionality, with whatever
additions I want. I don't use the lazyvim nixCats template because dealing with
the tight integration of mason.nvim seems like a hack.

If you want to try it, clone the repo and run `nix run`.
